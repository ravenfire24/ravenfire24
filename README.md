## Hi there 👋
I am a UH trained computer scientist with a strong foundation in software development and data science. I have hands-on experience in Python and C++ programming and a strong interest in building practical, data-driven solutions.

- 🚀 I’m currently working on developing robust inventory management systems using C++, designing interactive data visualizations in R, implementing machine learning models with Python, and MySQL database (here) (https://github.com/ravenfire24?tab=repositories)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in data visualization using RStudio, inventory management systems in C++, MySQL database and machine learning models for analyzing trends in sales data.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving predictive analytics, data-driven decision-making, and building efficient software solutions for inventory and resource management.
