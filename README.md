## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a UH trained computer scientist with a strong interest in areas like C++ programming and data science.

- ðŸš€ Iâ€™m currently working on developing robust inventory management systems using C++, designing interactive data visualizations in R, implementing machine learning models with Python, and MySQL database (here) (https://github.com/ravenfire24?tab=repositories)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced techniques in data visualization using RStudio, inventory management systems in C++, and machine learning models for analyzing trends in sales data.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects involving predictive analytics, data-driven decision-making, and building efficient software solutions for inventory and resource management.
